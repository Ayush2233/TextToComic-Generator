# TextToComic-Generator

This project explores the exciting intersection of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (specifically, Sdxl) to automatically generate comic strips from textual descriptions. It leverages the power of LLMs to understand narrative elements and translate them into visual concepts, while utilizing Sdxl's ability to translate those concepts into detailed comic panels.
